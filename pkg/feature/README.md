# Feature flags

This feature is based on the https://gofeatureflag.org/ library. When initialized with [`Initialize()`](./init.go)
it loads single toggle configuration yaml and stores an instance of the `*ffclient.GoFeatureFlag` 
in the [`provider`](./init.go) singleton variable. 

Each feature flag implemented in Cloud Manager should provide an anti corruption layer implementing 
the [`Feature`](./types/types.go) interface. In its implementation the actual flag value should be
obtained using the singleton instance in the [`provider`](./init.go) variable.

## Common evaluation context

Common evaluation context keys are defined as instances of the [`Key`](./types/types.go) type.
