# Cloud Manager Architecture Overview

Cloud Manager is a Kyma module managing cloud resources from cloud providers in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime virtual private cloud (VPC) network. 

## API and Reconcilers

Cloud Manager defines two API groups:
* `cloud-resources.kyma-project.io` - user-facing API available in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime
* `cloud-control.kyma-project.io` - low-level API in Kyma Control Plane (KCP) projected from the user-facing API in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

Cloud Manager has one central active component running in KCP that runs two sets of reconciliation loops - one for each API group.

Cloud Resources reconcilers remotely reconcile the `cloud-resources.kyma-project.io` API group 
from SAP BTP, Kyma runtime into the low-level `cloud-control.kyma-project.io` API group in KCP. Internally, the reconciliation process is called the **SKR Loop**.

Cloud Control reconcilers locally reconcile the `cloud-control.kyma-project.io` API group into the 
resources of a cloud provider - hyperscaler. Internally, the reconciliation process is called the **KCP Loop**.

Both sets of reconcilers must also maintain the status of the resources they reconcile. This means that Cloud Control 
reconcilers observe the status of the Cloud Resources resource group and project it into the status of the Cloud Control 
resources in KCP. At the same time, Cloud Resources reconcilers observe the status of the Cloud Control resources and 
project it into the status of the Cloud Control resource group in SKR.

## KCP Cloud Control Controller Manager

The Cloud Control reconcilers are managed by standard 
[controller-runtime controller manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/docs/controller-client-go.md) 
maintaining an active long-living connection to the KCP Kubernetes API. See the Kubernetes diagram showing how the various components in the client-go library work:

# SKR Cloud Resources Controller Manager

Due to the non-scalable concurrent reconciliation of large number of clusters the SKR Cloud Resources Controller Manager 
cannot keep long-living connections on the remote clusters permanently watching for changes. Instead, a custom
SKR Looper component loops through SKRs with the Cloud Manager module enabled, and instantiates new 
ControllerRuntime manager that lists all the "watched" (reconciler registered with the manager with `.For()` or `.Watches()` 
methods as defined in controller-runtime) and with them maintain a shot lived "cache" until all SKR reconcilers are 
called with respective resources they are managing. Once all is done, all resources for that SKR, shot-living cache, client... 
are disposed and the same process is repeated for the next SKR. 

The reconciler facing API like `Reconcile()` and `.SetupWithManager()` functions remains as close as possible to 
the one defined by controller-runtime and used by Kubebuilder.

## CloudControl Scope resource

Different cloud providers APIs require different connection options to define the scope of the operations:
* GCP - project
* Azure - tenant and subscription
* AWS - account

The SKR loop, when projecting into the KCP resources, sets the `kymaName` field as the indication of which SKR that 
resources refer to. So, the starting point for the KCP Loop reconcilers is the Kyma CR name. Following the path from 
Kyma CR in KCP to the Shoot CR in Gardener it is possible to determine the cloud provider scope. 

The Cloud Control KCP resource Scope was introduced to 
* improve performance by not reading so many different resources and reaching out to Gardener
* simplify the development landscape by not avoiding the necessity to beside the local KCP cluster and also have the Gardener cluster 
  with all the relevant resources

Upon the appearance of the first resource from a certain SKR the cloud provider scope is determined, saved in the 
Scope KCP resource and the original Cloud Control KCP resource is updated with the `scopeRef`. In dev, scope determination 
can be avoided by creating a resource already referring to an existing Scope resource. 

## IpRange

Some cloud resources require an allocation of a private IP, like an NFS instance. Since network security is managed 
differently in different cloud providers where some require firewall kind of access approval on the subnet level and 
in order not to be in a situation to modify the security configuation created by Gardener, a decision was made to 
allocate new subnets and not to provision such cloud resources into the nodes subnets. 

For those purposes the IpRange resource is introduced where a CIDR will be specified and subnets provisioned from it. 
So, the reconciliation of the IpRange results in the creating of the subnets in the cloud provider.

Some cloud providers define zone attribute on the subnet, resulting with as many nodes subnets as many the zone are. 
And some cloud providers don't have the zone on subnet, but only the region, resulting in only one node's subnet. 
Similarly, as many nodes subnets there are, as many cloud resources subnets will have to be created. If there's only 
one subnet, then the whole IpRange CIDR will be used for that one subnet. If there are more than one subnet, then 
the IpRange CIDR is split into smaller ranges that are allocated to each subnet. 

Any API resource representing a cloud resource that requires a private IP must have the reference to the IpRange resource.
