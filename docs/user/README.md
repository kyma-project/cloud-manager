# Cloud Manager Module

## What is Cloud Manager?

Cloud Manager is a central component that manages access to additional hyperscaler resources from the Kyma Runtime cluster. Its responsibility is to bring hyperscaler products/resources into the Kyma cluster in a secure way. Once Cloud Manager as a module is enabled in the Kyma cluster, Cloud Manager's features give you access to the respective products and resources of the hyperscaler providers.

## Features

Cloud Manager can provision the following cloud resources in the underlying cloud provider subscription:

* NFS server that can be used as a ReadWriteMany (RWX) volume in the Kyma cluster

## Architecture

Kyma Cloud Manager Operator runs in Kyma Control Plane and does remote reconciliation on Kyma clusters that
have the Cloud Manager module enabled. It brings various Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) each representing some
a specific cloud resource from the underlying cloud provider subscription.

## API / Custom Resources Definitions

### IpRange CR

The `iprange.cloud-resources.kyma-project.io` CRD describes the VPC network
IP range used for IP address allocation for cloud resources that require an IP address.
To learn more, read the [IpRange Custom Resource](./resources/04-10-iprange.md) documentation.

### AwsNfsVolume CR

The `awsnfsvolume.cloud-resources.kyma-project.io` CRD describes the AWS EFS
instance that can be used as RWX volume in the cluster.
To learn more, read the [AwsNfsVolume Custom Resource](./resources/04-20-10-aws-nfs-volume.md) documentation.

### GcpNfsVolume CR

The `gcpnfsvolume.cloud-resources.kyma-project.io` CRD describes the GCP Filestore
instance that can be used as RWX volume in the cluster.
To learn more, read the [GcpNfsVolume Custom Resource](./resources/04-30-10-gcp-nfs-volume.md)  documentation.
